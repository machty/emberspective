## Emberspective

A CSS3-powered visual guide to what's new or planned in Ember.js. If
desired, this project maybe split into its own standalone project for
presenting similar tree based data. 

This project is also meant to be an intermediate example of what can be
neatly coded up in Ember, as well as how it can be integrated with Rails
in a decently well-tested setting. 

## Work in Progress

[Here's a demo of how stuff's going](http://emberspective.herokuapp.com).

Still much to be done, but take a gander at the code. Would love to hear
from you about my approach, style, etc. I want this code to be generally
acceptable for intermediate Ember users to learn a thing or two from.

## Motivation

For both contributors and non-contributing Ember users, it's hard to
keep perspective of:

- New featuers being added to Ember
- Who's working on what
- What's taking so long on a particular previously-discussed topic
- What's planned in the coming months

Often, a lot of these questions can only be cleared up by a direct
interaction with someone extremely in-the-know, so it's my goal with
Emberspective to make it very easy to quickly see what's up, and have a
little more context of the existing problems people are solving before I
try to drum up a bunch of noise about some feature request that might
overlap with the momentum established in creating some other feature. 

The initial plan is that content will be driven by a limited access
Stypi document written in YAML, which is mostly working but still absent
from the demo, and eventually some more live data will be added by
querying Github for updates on issues linked to Emberspective story
nodes.
